# CoinPredictor
This project is all about probability. This Python script is supposed to predict the result of flipping a coin (even though this is actually impossible).

## How to use.
It's pretty simple to use this script...

1. Run it on the terminal.
2. Flip a coin.
3. Write your result(write **h** for head or **t** for tail)
4. Restart from step 2.
